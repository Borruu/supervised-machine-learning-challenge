# Supervised Machine Learning
## Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

This project uses said data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier will be compared.
