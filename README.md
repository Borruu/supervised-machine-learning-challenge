# Supervised Machine Learning

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

This project uses lending data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the **Logistic Regression model** and **Random Forest Classifier** will be created and compared.

## Stages
1. Retrieve the Data - `lending_data.csv` located in `Resources` folder
2. Predict model performance for Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier - recorded in markdown cells of `Credit Risk Evaluator.ipynb`
3. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
4. Create, Fit and Compare Models
